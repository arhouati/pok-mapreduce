## Synopsis
This project is an implementation of mapreduce algorithm based on Hadoop platform. In the map algorithm it uses pok-datamining to get oriention's opinion of each text, and in the reduce algorithm we calculate the sum of neutral and positive and negative opinions.

## Motivation

"pok-datamining" is a part of a platform named "POK". The main goal of this platform is retrieve public opinion from text content of blogs and social media networks.
